Artificial Intelligence Projects

## Project 1
8 puzzle using A* search. Uses misplaced and cityblock heuristics.

## Project 2
SAT Solver using WalkSat Algorithm. Model is a random assignment of True and False. Iterates through max flips and flip a random symbol until a solution is found.

## Project 3
Reads Bayesian Networks from BIF file are used to answer queries related to the variables represented in the network.

## Project 4
Program that can perform supervised learning using Decision Tree Learning algorithm. Outputs the decision tree, information about the tree and the training set. DTL is calculated by entropy and highest gain.
